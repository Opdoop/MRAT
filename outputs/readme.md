Our `trained models` and `adversarial examples` have been shared in [googledirve](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16J-nqKu4cjW8hNicmStQYqLgZitNhA6i) .

### Victim models

* Victim model of `mr` dataset is `bert-base-uncased-mr.zip`. Download and extract it to `outputs/training/bert-base-uncased-mr`.

* Victim model of `snli` dataset is `bert-base-uncased-snli` from [TextAttack Model Zoo](https://textattack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3recipes/models.html). It will be download automatically when needed. Do not need manual download.

### Adversarial examples 

* Adversarial examples of `mr` and `snli` datasets are in `attacks.zip`. Download and extract it to `output/attacks`.

### MRAT and MRAT+ models

* `MRAT` model trained on `mr` dataset is `bert-base-uncased-mr-mix-multi.zip`. Download and extract it to `outputs/training/bert-base-uncased-mr-mix-multi`.
* `MRAT+` model trained on `mr` dataset is `bert-base-uncased-mr-mixN-multi.zip`. Download and extract it to `outputs/training/bert-base-uncased-mr-mixN-multi`.

* `MRAT` model trained on `snli` dataset is `bert-base-uncased-snli-mix-multi.zip`. Download and extract it to `outputs/training/bert-base-uncased-snli-mix-multi`.
* `MRAT+` model trained on `mr` dataset is `bert-base-uncased-snli-mixN-multi.zip`. Download and extract it to `outputs/training/bert-base-uncased-snli-mixN-multi`.
